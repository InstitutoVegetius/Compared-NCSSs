{ESTONIA} can cope {CYBER THREATS} {SECURE} undisrupted {DIGITAL SOCIETY}, relying indivisibility {NATIONAL} {CAPABILITIES}, well-informed engaged {PRIVATE SECTOR}, outstanding {RESEARCH} development {COMPETENCE}. {ESTONIA} {INTERNATIONALLY} recognised leader {CYBERSECURITY}, standing supports {NATIONAL SECURITY} contributes growth global competitiveness {COMPANIES} operating domain. {ESTONIAN} {SOCIETY} perceives {CYBERSECURITY} shared responsibility everyone role play.
{ESTONIA} pursues vision following four fundamental principles:
. consider {PROTECTION} promotion {FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS} {FREEDOMS} important {CYBERSPACE} physical environment.

key challenges {ENSURING} {ESTONIAN} {CYBERSECURITY} not significantly different facing comparable countries. {ESTONIA} one world digitally dependent countries thus potential impacts {CYBER THREATS} much significant case many countries. following lists seven highest priority problems challenges identified preparation {STRATEGY}, currently hinder optimum functioning development field standardized solutions applied point not rectified.
limited {CAPABILITY} specialization
limited specialization {CAPABILITY} {PUBLIC SECTOR}, {PRIVATE} {COMPANIES} {RESEARCH} institutes fundamental problem small decreasing {POPULATION}. even though small community experts good interpersonal relationsh{IPS} ensures efficiency flexibility first {RESPONSE} crises {INCIDENTS}, strength represents not sustainable situation complexity {SYSTEMS} {THREATS} keeps growing. fragmented nature sectoral expertise prevents specialization top level, result turn danger top-level specialists will leave {ESTONIA} , , {PUBLIC SECTOR}.

insufficient {AWARENESS} low sense ownership
{AWARENESS} {CYBERSECURITY} still insufficient among {STATE} {PRIVATE SECTOR} leaders {SOCIETY} general, turn leads low sense responsibility. contributes {CYBERSECURITY} given short shrift development {INFORMATION SYSTEMS} {SERVICES}. {ENSURING} {CYBERSECURITY} not sensed {PERSONAL} responsibility {RISK} {ORGANIZATION} main {ACTIVITY}; rather, treated predominantly arcane {TECHNICAL} topic someone else must deal . volume {RESOURCES} directed {ENSURING} {INFORMATION} {SECURITY} {DEVELOPING} administering {SYSTEMS} not keeping needs arising development field growth burden regulators – challenge growing complexity part technology constant development keeps {INTENSIFYING}.
lack specialists, including insufficient {TRAINING} new specialists
 low level {COMPETENCE} {WORKFORCE} {PUBLIC PRIVATE SECTOR} affects fulfilment {STRATEGIC} objectives. {CYBERSECURITY} (labour) {MARKET} global subject constant competition best {TALENT}. top specialists {SUPPORT} {CRITICAL} {STATE} functions actively sought {ESTONIAN} foreign {COMPANIES}. challenge {GOVERNMENT} sector offer enough meaningful solutions, {FREEDOM} opportunity carry novel unique solutions. time, {INTERNATIONAL} reputation tech sector {CYBERSECURITY} {ESTONIA} increases (something {STATE} actively amplifying), pressure increasing {RECRUITMENT} specialists away {ESTONIA} {PRIVATE SECTOR} {INTERNATIONAL} {COMPANIES}. moreover, current {CYBERSECURITY} curricula not yet take needs {ESTONIAN} labour {MARKET} sufficient consideration, needs {WORKFORCE} not yet clearly mapped commissioned. lack flexible {RE-TRAINING} possibilities can cited shortcoming {CYBERSECURITY} curricula. problem sensed community sector acquisition necessary {CYBER} competencies curricula outside field cooperation {PUBLIC PRIVATE SECTOR} {RESEARCH} institutes, not sufficiently systematic.
low number successful {COMPANIES} sector insufficient volume & number {ESTONIAN} {COMPANIES} successfully {DEVELOPING} {CYBERSECURITY} {PRODUCT} {SERVICE} {INTERNATIONAL MARKETS} still low, considering {CYBERSECURITY} {SECURITY} {INDUSTRIES} major {EXPORT} potential considering {ESTONIA} strengths sector. important factor curtails development shortage specialists, impedes growth throughout {ICT} sector whole. not enough {RESOURCES} strategically important {RESEARCH} areas {CRYPTOGRAPHY} {SECURE} identification solutions.
 key question insufficient {COOPERATION STATE} {RESEARCH} institutions, stems limited {UNDERSTANDING} current future priorities {STATE} challenges planning {RESEARCH} {ACTIVITY}. just large problem insufficient cohesiveness {RESEARCH} {ENTERPRISE} – {COMMERCIALIZATION} {RESEARCH} results problem {ESTONIA} across {EUROPE}: {RESEARCH} published not result real prototypes, {PRODUCTS} {PATENTS}. strong capable {ENTERPRISE} sector {RESEARCH} development not contribute development {STATE} ({ECONOMIC GROWTH}); direct impact provider {SECURITY} {SERVICE} {STATE} needs – highly {DIGITALIZED} {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION} {ESTONIA} occasions need {INNOVATIVE} flexible solutions often unavailable foreign {ENTERPRISES} – role crisis reserve lean {STATE}, {ENSURING} existence {KNOWLEDGE} {TALENT} can drawn {STATE} needs emergency assistance.
maintaining {ESTONIA} reputation trusted valuable {INTERNATIONAL PARTNER} {ESTONIA} role among {CYBERSECURITY} leaders world, supports {EXCHANGE INFORMATION} {KNOWLEDGE} {ESTONIA} needs {STRATEGIC} {PARTNERS} amplifies {ESTONIA} voice {INTERNATIONAL ARENA}, not something self-sustaining – , rapidly changing competitive field rapid development taking place many countries. thus, {ESTONIA} {INTERNATIONAL} image not taken granted – although grown used – will not sustained inertia. therefore, additional efforts allocations additional {RESOURCES} needed.
