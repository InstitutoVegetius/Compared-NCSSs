 three ways resolve difficulty.
 first bring together <RESOURCES#PERSONNEL#CYBERSKILLS#CYBER·SKILLS> within structure works benefit
 several entities. thus, regions set , conjunction <STAKEHOLDERS#GOVERNMENT#ANSSI#ANSSI>, centres <ASSETS#CYBERSPACE#CYBERSPACE#CYBER>

lastly, third solution consist <RESOURCES#ACTIONS#PROMOTE#PROMOTING> within <RESOURCES#PERSONNEL#CYBERPROS#PROFESSIONAL> paths various
