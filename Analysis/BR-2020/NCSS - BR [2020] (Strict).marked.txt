. introduction
 {DIGITAL} revolution deeply transforming {SOCIETY}. last two decades, billions {PEOPLE} benefited exponential growth access {INTERNET}, rapid adoption {INFORMATION} {COMMUNICATION} technology {RESOURCES}, economic social opportunities arising {DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT}.
rapid advances area {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY} {COMMUNICATION} resulted intense use {CYBERSPACE} wide range {ACTIVITIES}, including provision {SERVICES} {FEDERAL GOVERNMENT}, consistent global trends. however, new growing {CYBER THREATS} arise proportion, put {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION} {SOCIETY} {RISK}.
thus, {PROTECTING} {CYBERSPACE} requires attentive vision leadership manage continuous political, technological, {EDUCATIONAL}, {LEGAL} {INTERNATIONAL} changes. sense, {GOVERNMENT}, {INDUSTRY}, {ACADEMIA} {SOCIETY} general shall {ENCOURAGE} {TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION} adoption {CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES}, maintain constant attention {NATIONAL SECURITY}, {ECONOMY} {FREE EXPRESSION}.
 higher level debates {SECURITY} {CYBERSPACE} {INFORMATION} {SECURITY}, systemic area, directly related {PROTECTION} set {INFORMATION} value individual {ORGANISATION}. thus, according article {DECREE} , , {INFORMATION} {SECURITY} comprehends {CYBERSECURITY}, {CYBER DEFENCE}, physical {SECURITY} {PROTECTION} organisational {DATA}, fundamental principles {CONFIDENTIALITY}, {INTEGRITY}, {AVAILABILITY} {AUTHENTICITY}.
 understood technological {RESOURCES} employed systemic {SECURITY} shall {SUPPORT} {POLICIES} {ENSURE} fundamental principles {DATA} {AUTHENTICITY} {INTEGRITY}, {PROVIDE} mechanisms {PROTECT} legitimacy {UNAUTHORISED CHANGE} disposal. likewise, {INFORMATION} collected, processed stored {INFORMATION} {COMMUNICATION} technology {INFRASTRUCTURE} shall accessible {AUTHORISED PERSONS}, processes entities, order {ENSURE} {CONFIDENTIALITY} {INFORMATION}. additionally, {INFORMATION} {COMMUNICATION} technology {RESOURCES} must {PROVIDE} permanent {AVAILABILITY} continuously {SUPPORT} {AUTHORISED ACCESSES}.
{E-CIBER}, addition filling important gap {NATIONAL} {NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK} {CYBERSECURITY}, establishes {ACTIONS} aimed modifying, cooperative way {NATIONAL} level, characteristics reflect positioning institutions {INDIVIDUALS} subject. first, turns good managerial initiatives area. however, fragmented punctual, making difficult converge efforts sector. second, lack normative, {STRATEGIC} operational alignment, often generates rework results {CONSTITUTION} task forces specific {ACTIONS}, impairing absorption {LESSONS LEARNED} jeopardising prolonged {EFFECTIVENESS} {ACTIONS}. third, observed existence different levels {CYBERSECURITY MATURITY} {SOCIETY}, results varied perceptions real importance topic.

. adopted methodology
 {STRATEGY} result work carried representatives {PUBLIC BODIES}, {PRIVATE ENTITIES}, {ACADEMIA}, participated series {TECHNICAL} meetings discuss various aspects {CYBERSECURITY}. considering wide range subjects, representatives divided three subgroups, constituted follows:
- subgroup - {CYBER GOVERNANCE}, normative dimension, {RESEARCH}, development {INNOVATION}, {EDUCATION}, {INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION} {STRATEGIC} partnersh{IPS};
- subgroup - {DIGITAL TRUST} {PREVENTION} mitigation {CYBER THREATS};
- subgroup - {STRATEGIC} {PROTECTION} - {GOVERNMENT} {PROTECTION} {INFRASTRUCTURE} {PROTECTION}.
thirty-one meetings subgroups held, {EFFECTIVE} participation representatives remarkable {KNOWLEDGE}, enabled {EXCHANGE KNOWLEDGE} ideas, contributed decisively {ESTABLISH} {STRATEGIC} design.
 order structure debates, work followed four stages:
first - diagnosis - survey mapping initiatives, related {ACTORS} existing {ACTIONS};
second - subgroup debates - weekly meetings related {ACTORS} guests notorious {KNOWLEDGE};
third - public consultation – provision document {INTERNET} contributions broad participation {SOCIETY} general;
fourth - {APPROVAL} publication - finalisation proposal submission presidential {APPROVAL}.
additionally, considered {CYBERSECURITY CAPACITY} maturity {MODEL} [], defines five dimensions:
- {CYBERSECURITY POLICY} {STRATEGY};
- cybernetic societal {CULTURE};
- {CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION}, {TRAINING} {SKILLS};
- {LEGAL} {REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS};
- {STANDARDS}, {ORGANISATIONS} technologies.
 dimensions, due transversality, cover extensive areas shall considered increasing {CYBERSECURITY CAPACITY}. considering five dimensions {MODEL}, structure seven axes {STRATEGY} , previously mentioned, maintains direct relationship {CYBERSECURITY CAPACITY} maturity {MODEL}, reached.
 thematic axes {E-CIBER} considered transversal way, can described :
- {PROTECTION} {SECURITY} axes:
- {NATIONAL} {CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE};
- connected {SECURE} universe: {PREVENTION} mitigation {CYBER THREATS};
- {STRATEGIC} {PROTECTION};
- transformative axes:
- normative dimension;
- {INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION} {STRATEGIC} partnersh{IPS};
- {RESEARCH}, development {INNOVATION};
- {EDUCATION}.
 methodology described allowed gathering relevant {INFORMATION}, resulted systemic {NATIONAL} {STRATEGIC} conception.
 final conclusions work resulted first version {E-CIBER}, made available participation {SOCIETY} form public consultation, launched via {INTERNET} september , , made available twenty consecutive days accessed forty-one participants. total, thirty-one {INDIVIDUALS} ten {PUBLIC PRIVATE ORGANISATIONS} sent one hundred sixty-six contributions. analysing contributions received, present version approved excellency {PRESIDENT REPUBLIC}.
