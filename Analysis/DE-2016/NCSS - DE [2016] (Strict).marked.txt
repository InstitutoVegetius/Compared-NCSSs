{CYBER THREATS}
 {CYBER THREAT} situation {GERMANY} characterised increasing complexity interdependency technology used constantly changing {THREATS}. {DIGITALISATION} modern societies, {VULNERABILITY} potential abuse {CYBERSPACE} growing. addition, {PRIVACY} {CITIZENS} becoming {INCREASINGLY} {VULNERABLE}.
 consequences {CYBERATTACKS} not limited {CYBERSPACE}. successful {ATTACKS} can cause social, economic, political {PERSONAL} damage. {ATTACKS} {STATE} institutions aiming spying {SABOTAGING} can significantly impair functionality {ADMINISTRATION}, {ARMED FORCES} {SECURITY} {AGENCIES} thus impact public {SECURITY} order {GERMANY}.
{CYBERATTACKS} {ENERGY SUPPLY NETWORKS} can bring large areas {PUBLIC PRIVATE} life standstill. targeted {CYBERATTACKS} {BANKING INFRASTRUCTURES} {PRICE MANIPULATION} can pose {THREAT} financial markets whole far-reaching effects {ECONOMY} {GERMANY} around world. manipulation automated networked driving, it-based {TRAFFIC CONTROL} applications healthcare sector can pose genuine serious {RISKS} life limb {CITIZENS}.
 {TARGETED DISSEMINATION FALSE REPORTS}, made possible hijacked {SYSTEMS}, can used {DISINFORMATION} {MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION}. poses long-term {THREATS} free {SOCIETY} {DEMOCRACY}.
 {ATTACKERS} often {CRIMINAL}, extremist/{TERRORIST}, {MILITARY} {INTELLIGENCE} background. quantitative qualitative diversity potential {PLAYERS} home abroad {TECHNICAL} possibilities concealment make difficult {IDENTIFY}, assign, {DEFEND} track {CYBERATTACKS}. {POLITICAL-MILITARY} conflicts often accompanied {CYBER CAMPAIGNS} carried {CYBERSPACE} threshold armed conflict. complicates political {ASSESSMENT} {CYBERATTACKS} decision appropriate countermeasures.
 number quality {CYBERATTACKS} continuously increasing often encounter inadequately secured {SYSTEMS}. {ATTACKS} highly {PROFESSIONAL}. {ATTACK} tools now available {GOVERNMENT} {ACTORS} well {CRIMINAL} groups {INDIVIDUALS}. classic {DEFENCE} tools often no longer sufficient, particularly relation technologically sophisticated {MALWARE} {PROGRAMS}. {ATTACKERS} technically able hide {CYBERATTACKS} hide {PERPETRATORS}. reason, {CYBERATTACKS} origin {INCREASINGLY} impossible determine, great effort considerable time delays. large number previously unknown {ATTACKS} can assumed.
